## Lorem Ipsum Dictionary
You may want to add lorem ipsum text as a placeholder for text as you create a web page so you can see what the page will look like with text. You can do this by typing in the word `lorem` and pressing the `Tab` key to get 30 words of lorem ipsum text. If you use a number after the keyword, e.g., `lorem15`, you will get that number of words.

The Code Spell Checker extension will, by default, flag lorem ipsum text as being spelled incorrectly because it does not recognize the words. However, you can add in a lorem ipsum dictionary to the extension so the lorem ipsum text is not flagged as being incorrect. This can help to simplify the error messages to those words that are actually misspelled. To add the dictionary (after the extension has been installed):

1. Open the VS Code Settings (Under the File menu, Preferences option).
2. Search for `c spell dictionary` in the search box without quotes.
3. Find the _C Spell: Dictionary_ heading in the list of settings.
4. Click the _Add item_ button.
5. Type in `lorem-ipsum`.
6. Click the OK button to add it. You should now see it listed as a dictionary.
7. Close the Settings tab.

Any lorem ipsum text within your HTML documents should now be recognized.
